      - The reciprocal of the distance to closest food pellet

          one to have a limited value on the change in score
        - The score drop due to the increased distance to the next
          nearest pellet should be less than the score gain from
          eating the pellet.
      - The negative reciprocal of the distance to the closest ghost
        - A close ghost makes the state less desirable, but variances
          in ghosts far away should have little impact
      - The reciprocal of the distance to the closest power pellet
